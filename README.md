# jekyll-theme-nostalgia
The original "plain" HTML theme, in Jekyll.

## Why does it function?




Well, the story begins with [Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), currently CSS3. CSS is not a programming language nor HTML, but therefore while JavaScript is a programming language, you actually use JS to program HTML.

So, Jekyll would work with the plain style, meaning you can format plain HTML using Markdown.
