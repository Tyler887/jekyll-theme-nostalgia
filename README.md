# jekyll-theme-nostalgia
The original "plain" HTML theme, in Jekyll.

The plain theme is formatted like this:
```css
* {
  font-family: serif
  background-colour: white
}
```

## Why does it function?




Well, the story begins with [Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), currently CSS3. CSS is not a programming language nor HTML, but therefore while JavaScript is a programming language, you actually use JS to program HTML.

So, Jekyll would work with the plain style, meaning you can format plain HTML using Markdown. An example is at the [Github Pages website](https://tyler887.github.io/jekyll-theme-nostalgia).
